SKY UNATTENDED TEST DOCUMENTATION:

I will give a brief overview of the less obvious tests.

For the testing of the PHP upload, a server is necessary. To simulate it myself I used Xampp, if you wish to install this, just extract my "Sky" folder into \xampp\htdocs, and navigate in your web browser of choice to http://localhost/sky/ .

The web browser I used for testing was chrome as it has the most advanced and useful developer features. I did do a small test on FFQuantum, but the sliders do not look to specification.
I also left a few lines of CSS which were related to the borders shown in the specification diagram.

The main page including the moodsliders is Home.html, and Upload.html is the facility for uploading the XML file.
Once the file is uploaded it will be placed in the Uploads folder.

I made a few additions to the example ml file for compatibility with my reading method, such as changing the form of the quote marks describing the format. So I recommend using the Data.xml file within the Sky directory for testing.

There were also multiple ways I thought that analyzing multiple moods may work depending on the XML data provided. Rather than just a simple "two moods".
An optimal way of configuring it would be to have a 4 value scoring system for each show, and the work out the closest match via an average of differences, between the show and the users current selection.

If you have any other questions feel free to ask.

One improvement I considered making but it wasn't in the specification was an "inverse mood" button. It seemed intuitive that if I was feeling down, I would want to watch something to cheer me up. I would only watch something scary if I was feeling brave. etc.

Thanks for the opportunity.

Gregory Hallam.
